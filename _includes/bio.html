	<h2>About Me</h2>
	I am a second year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS)</a> at the  <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Australian National University</a>,
	where I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vNHqr3oAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Prof. Liang Zheng</a> and 
	<a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=YvdzeM8AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Prof. Stephen Gould</a>. <br><br>
	
	Previously, I was a research intern at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Adobe Research</a>. Prior to that, I had graduated from <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/postgraduate/master-machine-learning-and-computer-vision" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Masters of Machine learning and Computer Vision</a> with first class honours from the Australian National University.
	Even earlier, I was working as a machine learning research engineer at <a href="https://www.yahoo.co.jp/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Yahoo Japan</a>. I received my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering with specialization in <em>intelligent and cognitive systems</em> from <a href="http://www.iitd.ernet.in/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">IIT Delhi</a>.<br><br>
	
    <!-- I am a postgraduate student pursuing the <em>Masters of Machine learning and Computer Vision</em> at the <b>Australian National University</b>. Currently, I am working on research problems in the fields of computer vision and reinforcement learning under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vNHqr3oAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Liang Zheng</a>.<br><br> -->

	<!-- Previously, I was working as a machine learning research engineer at <b>Yahoo Japan, Tokyo</b>. I received my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering with specialization in <em>intelligent and cognitive systems</em> from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (<b>IIT Delhi</b>).<br><br> -->
	
	<!-- My broad research interests are at the intersection of computer vision and deep reinforcement learning. -->
	I am currently engaged in exploring a novel approach to interactive image synthesis and editing, by using deep reinforcement learning for understanding <i>human visual user-intention</i> (<i>i.e.</i> what a user wants to draw) from the primitive human inputs (<i>e.g.</i> coarse scribbles).
	We believe that applications from this research can provide human-users with new ways to better express their inner ideas in direct visual form. <br><br>

	<!-- My research interests include computer vision, deep reinforcement learning, vision and language navigation, biologically inspired (deep) learning algorithms, smart adversarial game-playing agents.</p> -->
